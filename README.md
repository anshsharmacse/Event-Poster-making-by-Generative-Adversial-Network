# Event-Poster-making-by-Generative-Adversial-Network
This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate creative event posters based on a dataset of real posters and metadata (event type, theme). The model is evaluated using visual inspection and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID). A Fast API enables users to generate posters from textual inputs.
